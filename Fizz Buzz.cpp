 In this question, we want to interate through 1 to the target integer using a for loop, or while loop. In this case, I chose for loop.
 if we reached an integer that is dividable by 3 and not dividable by 5, we convert it to Fizz and push it to vector list.
 if we reached an integer that is dividable by 5 rather than 3 , we convert it to Buzz and push it to vector list.
 if can be divided by both 3 and 5, we push "FizzBuzz" to the vector list.
 otherwise, if the integer can neither be divided by 3 nor 5, we just convert that integer to a string and push it to the vector list.
 
 
 Finally, when we've tracked all the integers in range, return the vector list.
